.SH NAME
ezmlm-reject \- reject messages unsuitable for distribution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-reject
[
.B \-bBcChFfHqQsStT
][
.I dir
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-reject
reads a mail message from its standard input.
It rejects the message if it sees something it doesn't like.

If the message has a ``Precedence: junk'' header,
.B ezmlm-reject
exits 99 causing the message to be ignored. This causes replies from (some)
vacation programs to be ignored.

.B ezmlm-reject
rejects messages that are outside a configured size range (see
.I dir\fB/msgsize
below).
If a list of MIME types to reject is present,
.B ezmlm-reject
will reject any message that is or contains a listed content-type.  If a
list of MIME types to keep is present,
.B ezmlm-reject
will reject any message that both is not and does not contain a listed
content-type.  Otherwise if a list of MIME types to remove is present,
.B ezmlm-reject
will reject any message that is one of the listed content-types.
Individual parts of a composite MIME messages will be stripped out later
by
.BR ezmlm-send(1) .

.B ezmlm-reject
will exit 100 (permanent error) for rejections. If the list address is not in
the message ``To:'' or ``Cc:'' headers and the
.B \-t
switch is active, the exit code is 100 or 99, depending on the
.B \-q
switch (see below).
If you would like to forward messages instead of rejecting them, you can
into the appropriate .qmail file put:

.EX
	|condredirect newaddress except /path/ezmlm-reject DIR
.EE

Now rejected posts will
go to this address, and the recipient can take appropriate action.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b
Reject the message if the message body starts ``subscribe''
or ``unsubscribe''. If the
.B \-c
switch is specified, messages will also be rejected if the subject starts
with these words.
.TP
.B \-B
(Default.)
Do not reject messages starting ``subscribe'' or ``unsubscribe''.
.TP
.B \-c
(Default.)
Commands are not permitted in the Subject line.
A Subject line consisting solely of HELP, REMOVE, SUBSCRIBE, or UNSUBSCRIBE
is rejected.
.TP
.B \-C
Commands are permitted in the subject line.
.TP
.B \-f
Forward all messages having a command as the subject line to the list's
-request address for processing.  This is only effective if
.B \-c
is also set.
.TP
.B \-F
(Default.)
Do not forward command messages.
.TP
.B \-h
Reject message if any of the headers in
.I dir\fB/headerreject
occur in the header. Mailing-List headers of other mailing list managers
can be put into this file, one per line, to prevent processing of messages
from other mailing lists.
.I dir
must be specified.

A reasonable set of headers would be: ``Mailing-List'', ``X-ml-name'',
\``ml-name'',``X-loop'',``X-listprocessor-version'',``X-mailing-list''. Case
is not important.
.TP
.B \-H
(Default.)
Ignore
.IR dir\fB/headerreject .
.B \-q
Quiet. If the message due to the lack of the list address (see
.BR \-t )
is not accepted, this is logged but no error message is sent to the sender.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet. If a message due to the lack of the list address (see
.BR \-t )
is not accepted,
the message is silently ignored.
.TP
.B \-Q
(Default.)
Not quiet. If a message due to the lack of the list address (see
.BR \-t )
is not accepted,
the sender is notified by an error message.
.TP
.B \-s
(Default.)
A nonempty Subject line is required.
.TP
.B \-S
A Subject line is not required.
.TP
.B \-t
(Default.)
Reject messages that do not have the list address in the ``To:'' or ``Cc:''
header(s).
.B ezmlm-reject
needs access to
.I dir\fB/outhost
and
.I dir\fB/outlocal
to check this. This check is silently omitted if
.I dir
is not specified, to assure backwards compatibility with existing ezmlm lists.
.TP
.B \-T
Do not require the list address in the ``To:'' or ``Cc:'' header(s).
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILES"
If
.I dir
is specified on the command line,
.B ezmlm-reject
reads the following configuration files.
.TP
.I dir\fB/copylines
The number of lines of the original message body to copy into the
response message.  If this file is not present or empty, no lines will
be copied.  The full header is always copied.
.TP
.I dir\fB/msgsize
The message size limits expressed as "maxsize:minsize".  Either number
will be ignored if it is 0 or omitted.
.TP
.I dir\fB/mimekeep
The list of MIME types to keep.
.TP
.I dir\fB/mimereject
The list of MIME types to reject.
.TP
.I dir\fB/mimeremove
The list of MIME types to remove.
.SH BUGS
.B ezmlm-reject
does not handle rfc822 comments in ``Content-Type:'' lines if present
before the type or boundary.
This could be used to defeat the
MIME rejection function.
OTOH, this function is intended to reduce garbage, not guarantee
its elimination.

Since the MIME parser doesn't decode inner MIME layers of a 
.I "multipart/*"
message,
.I mimeremove
and
.I mimereject
will be applied to the outer MIME layer only.

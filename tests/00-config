# DEBUG=1
# This program is meant to test ezmlm-idx.
# Several criteria have to be met for this to work:
# 0. you need to have qmail installed allowing mail delivery to
#    "eztest@host" and subaddresses.
# 2. you need to have a user "eztest" or edit the script to change to a
#	user that exists on your system.
# 3. you need to be that user when you invoke this script and the script
#	needs to reside in the same dir as the binaries you want to test.
# 4. this user needs to have execute permission for the build dir
#
# The script will use ~eztest/__TSTDIR and ~eztest/__TSTDIR__err and destroy
# any files therein. Both user name and directory names etc can be configured
# below, but this should only very rarely be necessary.
#
# This program is experimental and not yet properly documented. Please
# send comments to lindberg@id.wustl.edu. I'm attempting to make this a
# rigorous test for future ezmlm+idx installations so that full function
# can be verified when upgrading to a new version.

-ezmlm-idx does not implement a full rfc822 parser. Comments can be
 inserted to defeat the MIME parsing mechanism, such as:
 Content-Type: (comment) test/plain
 This type of comment, while legal, does not occur in normal messages.
 Guiding info past ezmlm-idx MIME parsing is easier done by enclosing
 a message within a message. The mechanism isn't intended as a
 "secure" way of preventing e.g. "application/ms-tnef" from being
 disseminated.
 If you think this is a problem, E-mail ezmlm@lists.untroubled.org

-Mimeremove/reject work only at the outer MIME layer.

-ezmlm-request requires addresses to be user@host. While rfc822
 compliant, addresses like ``"the man" @ host'' are not accepted.

-ezmlm-cgi doesn't deal optimally with holes in the archive.

-ezmlm-cgi seems not to work with Chinese. The problem has been to
 find someone willing/able to participate in debugging.

Some ezmlmrc are not updated and may not work right.  If you fix them,
please send them to ezmlm@lists.untroubled.org for inclusion in the next
release.

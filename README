This software originated from ezmlm-0.53, written by Dan J. Bernstein,
which has now been placed into the public domain. ezmlm provided basic
message distribution, subscriber address handling, message archiving
(single message retrieval only), and bounce handling.

ezmlm-idx adds multi-message threaded archive retrieval, digests, remote
administration, message and subscription moderation, subscriber-only
restrictions, message trailer, subject prefix, subscriber name storage,
customizable setup, multi-language and MIME support and more. In
addition, improved bounce handling, case-insensitive subscriber address
storage, support for distributed lists (main + sublist transparent to
the subscriber), and alternate subscriber databases.

*Problem with dynamic error texts: sub modules contain a private copy of
the library, and so won't have their errmap initialized.  May require
dynamic libezmlm.
*ezmlm-make needs to call errtxt_init at some point.

Put a real address into To: header in ezmlm-store (and others?)
add ezmlm-receipt to build system (needs to be fixed to compile)
add support for simultaneous multiple languages
Add support for run-time configurable error texts (errtxt.h).
Add a wrapper for ezmlm-issubn to take the place of the
  @REJECTPOSTS@ and @ONLYSUBSCRIBERS@ bits in the ezmlmrc.template

Rewrite man pages to include a separate "configuration files" section.

Move confirm-related directories in "mod" to new "confirm" directory?

Refactor all header generation into a single module:
-Write headers into a stralloc.
-Code functions to find/add/replace/remove headers.
-Parse a file to do above as well.
-Dump the block to qmail and free.

Missing text files:
unsub-confirm nl
post-confirm ch_GB cs da de es hu id ja nl pl pt pt_BR ru sv
sub-confirm#s de en_US es fr hu id it ja nl sv

Implement pre/post (un)subscribe hooks (and possibly others):
-Set up "hooks" directory
-If hooks/NAME exists, execute it at appropriate time

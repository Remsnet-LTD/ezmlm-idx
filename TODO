Figure out how to get rid of -fPIC in conf-cc
  Maybe make conf-ccso and conf-ldso, with flags to add to the normal
  conf-cc and conf-ld ?
Only compile files in lib/ and *=so with PIC flags

Modify initsub to take the contents of the subdb file as a parameter
  (if not given, then load up the DIR/subdb file)
Modify the programs that call subdb functions with flagsql=0 to use the
above with subdb="std".
Move the "std" subdb into a plugin.

Fixup man pages and FAQ.idx regarding modsub and remote contents
?Remove "dir" argument from getconf?

Put a real address into To: header in ezmlm-store (and others?)
Fix email addresses in INSTALL.idx
add ezmlm-receipt to build system (needs to be fixed to compile)
fix manual subscriptions to mod/allow/deny/digest when using SQL
add support for simultaneous multiple languages
Fix ezmlm-tests to work even if conf-bin<>$PWD
Add support for run-time configurable error texts (errtxt.h).

Rewrite man pages to include a separate "configuration files" section.

Move confirm-related directories in "mod" to new "confirm" directory?

Refactor all header generation into a single module:
-Write headers into a stralloc.
-Code functions to find/add/replace/remove headers.
-Parse a file to do above as well.
-Dump the block to qmail and free.

Missing text files:
unsub-confirm nl
post-confirm ch_GB cs da de es hu id ja nl pl pt pt_BR ru sv
sub-confirm#s de en_US es fr hu id it ja nl sv

Implement pre/post (un)subscribe hooks (and possibly others):
-Set up "hooks" directory
-If hooks/NAME exists, execute it at appropriate time

Tests:
-headerkeep/remove in ezmlm-request

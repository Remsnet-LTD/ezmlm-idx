.SH NAME
ezmlm-send \- distribute a message to a mailing list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-send
[
.B \-cCrRvV
] [
.B \-h\fI header
]
.I dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-send
reads a mail message and
sends it to the mailing list stored in
.IR dir .
If the message is to be archived,
.B ezmlm-send
records a copy of the message in the
.I dir\fB/archive/
directory.

If the message is to be indexed,
.B ezmlm-send
adds the subject, author and time stamp of the message to the index, kept with
the message in a subdirectory of
.IR dir\fB/archive/ .
The subject is processed to make reply-subject entries identical to
original
message subject entries.
The subject index is used for the archive retrieval functions of
.BR ezmlm-get(1) .  
Use
.B ezmlm-idx(1)
to create a subject index from a preexisting archive.

Subject and author lines are decoded if they are encoded per rfc2047. When
split lines are unfolded, the number of escape sequences for
iso-2022-* character sets is minimized. For instance, two
consequtive toascii sequences are reduced.
This processing is done for the character set specified in
.IR dir\fB/charset .
The result of this process is the same for a given subject, irrespective
of encoding.

.B ezmlm-send
normally rejects the message if it contains a
.B Mailing-List
field (but see
.B SUBLISTS
below).

.B ezmlm-send
modifies the header according to the contents of
.IR dir\fB/headeradd ,
.IR dir\fB/headerkeep ,
.IR dir\fB/headerremove ,
and
.I dir\fB/listid
(see
.B CONFIGURATION FILES
for details).
.B ezmlm-send
also adds an appropriate
.B Delivered-To
line the outgoing header.

If
.I dir\fB/text/trailer
exists,
.B ezmlm-send
adds the trailer to simple text/plain messages in the same encoding as used for
the the message. However, if the encoding is ``base64'' it is not safe
to do this and the header is suppressed.
For composite MIME messages, the trailer is added as a separate
part, with the character set and encoding specified in
.IR dir\fB/charset .
The trailer is not added to multipart/alternative messages.
Any tags, ``<#h#>'', ``<#l#>'', ``<#L#>'', or ``<#n#>'' found in
.I dir\fB/text/trailer
are replaced by the list host name, list local name, list base name, and
message number, respectively.

.I dir\fB/sequence
is ignored as of ezmlm-idx-0.32. Use
.I dir\fB/headeradd
with substitution to achieve the same goal.

.B ezmlm-send
does not distribute bounce messages:
if the environment variable
.B SENDER
is set, and is either empty or
.BR #@[] ,
.B ezmlm-send
rejects the message.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
No longer supported. Ignored for backwards compatibility.
.TP
.B \-C
No longer supported. Ignored for backwards compatibility.
.B ezmlm-send
has to parse the subscriber database.
.TP
.B \-h\fI header
If the list is a sublist
.I header
is required in all messages to the list. This option is used
when ezmlm is used to run a sublist of a lists run by a different
mailing list
manager that uses
.I header
rather than ``Mailing-List'' to identify messages from the list.
Anything after the first colon (if present) in
.I header
is ignored.
.TP
.B \-r
Copy incoming ``Received:'' headers to the outgoing message.
.TP
.B \-R
(Default.)
Do not copy incoming ``Received:'' headers, except the one added by
the (last) listhost, to the outgoing message.
In some
cases, especially for sublists,
the messages can have a large number of ``Received:''
headers. This may lead to bounces for some users due to
sendmail ``hopcounts'' set too low somewhere in the mail path. These users can
subscribe and receive warning and probe messages, but no list messages, unless
the number of ``Received:'' headers is reduced.

Pre-list ``Received:'' headers are of little interest to normal list
subscribers. ``Received:'' headers are
still copied to the archive and available
to anyone from there for message tracking purposes.
.TP
.B \-v

.B ezmlm-send
version information.

.B \-V

.SH "CONFIGURATION FILES"
.TP
.I dir\fB/archived
If present, the message will be archived.
.TP
.I dir\fB/charset
See
.B CHARACTER SETS
below.
.TP
.I dir\fB/headeradd
The contents of this file are added to the outgoing message.  Any tags,
``<#h#>'', ``<#l#>'', ``<#L#>'', or ``<#n#>'' found in these headers are
replaced by the list host name, list local name, list base name, and
message number, respectively.
.TP
.I dir\fB/headerkeep
If present,
.B ezmlm-send
deletes any incoming header fields with names listed in this file.
.TP
.I dir\fB/headerremove
If
.I dir\fB/headerkeep
is not present,
.B ezmlm-send
deletes any incoming header fields with names listed in this file.
.TP
.I dir\fB/indexed
If present, the message will be indexed.
.TP
.I dir\fB/listid
The contents of this file are added to the header of the outgoing
message prefixed by ``List-ID: ''.
.TP
.I dir\fB/mailinglist
The contents of this file are copied into a new
.B Mailing-List:
header in the response.
.TP
.I dir\fB/mimekeep
If present,
.B ezmlm-send
removes all MIME part types not specified in this file.
.TP
.I dir\fB/mimeremove
If
.I dir\fB/mimekeep
is not present,
.B ezmlm-send
removes all MIME part types specified in this file.
.TP
.I dir\fB/prefix
If this file exists,
.B ezmlm-send
will prefix the subject line with the first line of this
file. A space will be added to separate
.B prefix
from the subject text.
.B prefix
is ignored for sublists. If
.I dir\fB/prefix
contains a ``#'', the last ``#'' will be replaced by the message number.
Any prefix starting with text of a reply indicator (``Re:'', ``Re[n]:'',
etc) will cause problems.  The prefix may be rfc2047 encoded. Rfc2047
Iso-2022-* encoded prefixes
.I must
end in ascii.

The prefix feature and especially the message number feature modify the
message in violation with Internet mail standards. The features have
been implemented by popular demand. Use at your own peril.

In general, the use of a prefix is discouraged. It wastes subject line space,
creates trouble when MUAs add non-standard reply indicators. However, many
users expect it not because it is useful, but because they are used to it.
.TP
.I dir\fB/qmqpservers
If this file exists,
.B ezmlm-send will use
.B qmail-qmqp(1)
to send messages.
.TP
.I dir\fB/sublist
If this file is present, the list behaves as a sublist (see
.B SUBLISTS
below).
.SH "SUBLISTS"
If
.I dir\fB/sublist
exists,
.B ezmlm-send
changes its behavior in several ways.

First, if
.B SENDER
is set,
and the first line of
.I dir\fB/sublist
has the form
.IR parent\fB@\fIparenthost ,
.B ezmlm-send
insists that
.B SENDER
have the form
.IR parent\fB...@\fIparenthost .

Second,
.B ezmlm-send
demands that the message already have a
.B Mailing-List
field.

Third,
.B ezmlm-send
does not add its own
.B Mailing-List
field.

Fourth,
.B ezmlm-send
uses the incoming message number for the outgoing message, if the list
is not archived and the incoming SENDER has the correct format.
This allows you to refer bounce warning recipients to the main list for
archive retrieval of the missed messages. If the sublist archives
message, it is assumed that missed messages will be retrieved from the sublist
archive.

The list
still increments
.I dir\fB/num
for each message. If the sublist is archived, use of incoming message number
for archive storage would be a security risk. In this case, the local sublist
message number is used.
.SH "CHARACTER SETS"
If the list is indexed,
.B ezmlm-send
will keep a message index. rfc2047-encoded subject and from lines will be
decoded.
If
.I dir\fB/charset
exists,
.B ezmlm-send
will eliminate redundant escape sequences from the headers according to
the character set specified in this file.
Only character sets using escape sequences need this support. Currently,
supported are iso-2022-jp*, iso-2022-kr, and iso-2022-cn*. Only iso-2022-jp
has been tested extensively.

The character set can be suffixed
by ``:'' followed by a code. Recognized codes are ``Q'' 
for ``Quoted-Printable'', and ``B'' for ``base64''.

For
.BR ezmlm-send ,
this affects the format of the trailer, if a trailer is specified and if the
message is a multipart mime message
.SH BUGS
Since the MIME parser doesn't decode inner MIME layers of a 
.I "multipart/*"
message,
.IR mimekeep ,
.IR mimeremove ,
and
.I mimereject
will be applied to the outer MIME layer only.
